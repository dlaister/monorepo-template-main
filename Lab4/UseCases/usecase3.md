# Use Case 3

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Space key clears canvas.*

**Primary Actor**: *User.*

**Goal in Context**: *To have the space key clear the content(s) on the window canvas.*

**Preconditions**: *conditions that must be true before the scenario may play out*

**Trigger**: *Pressing the space key.*
  
**Scenario**: *A user will press the space key when they wish to clear the window canvas of all prior input.*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system. The window canvas might already be clean and prompt a dialog box stating the window canvas is cleared, and does not need to be cleared again.*

**Priority**: *High-priority.*

**When available**: *First release.*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates through I/O devices. This includes the keyboard and the mouse. The system is responsible for maintaining focus of the window when the user clicks, and should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for all other input.*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A.*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A.*

**Open Issues**: *We may need a dialog/action box in the event the window canvas has already been cleared to a default state.*
